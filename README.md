# AI_ASSIGNMENT02_CT-22059_AREEBA_BATOOL

This project implements a **Tic Tac Toe** game using Python.  
It features:
- **AI opponent** that uses the **Minimax algorithm** with optional **Alpha-Beta Pruning**.
- **Performance testing** to compare Standard Minimax vs Alpha-Beta Pruning (measuring nodes evaluated and time taken).
- **Human vs AI gameplay** where the human plays as 'O' and the AI plays as 'X'.
- **Move history tracking** to allow undoing moves during AI evaluation.
- **Game states** for empty board, mid-game, and end-game scenarios.
